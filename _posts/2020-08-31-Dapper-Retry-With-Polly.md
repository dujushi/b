While [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/){:target="_blank"} has a [connection resiliency](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/connection-resiliency){:target="_blank"} feature to retry failed database commands, [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper){:target="_blank"} doesn't. [Ben Hyrman](https://hyr.mn/){:target="_blank"} wrote a nice article [SQL Server Retries with Dapper and Polly](https://hyr.mn/dapper-and-polly/){:target="_blank"} to show us how they use [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly.Extensions.Http){:target="_blank"} to support this. By following the article, I wrote a tiny [sample project](https://github.com/dujushi/Garage.Polly.Extensions.Dapper){:target="_blank"} for my future reference.
