title: How to Start ReactJS Development
---
I started learning ReactJS about two months ago. Recently I built one simple SPA (Single Page App) with React-Router and Flux.

I was searching hard for ReactJS materials to enhance my ReactJS skills. There are so many technologies around it which makes me feel overwhelmed. I learned Gulp for front end automation. And then I found Webpack is much better so I switched to Webpack. ES6 is just fantastic so I decided to learn ES6 as well and made my simple app with ES6. After that I added React-Router and Flux. It seems there are much more to learn to master these skills and I cannot just learn all of them at once. What should be the priority of learning these skills?

Pete Hunt wrote a great [react-howto](https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto){:target="_blank"} document. He listed the priorities which are quite clear and smart. I may follow the list along and check my skills one by one. Pete has another great [webpack-howto](https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto){:target="_blank"}. And you should definitely watch his youtube video [OSCON 2014: How Instagram.com Works](http://youtu.be/VkTCL6Nqm6Y){:target="_blank"} if you want to start SPA development.
